# PullRequest Test Coverage Report Action

This action will report test coverage summary of the pull-request touched files in the description. It works with the json coverage-summary generated by `Istanbul` reporter.

## Inputs

### `token`
**Required** The GitHub authentication token (workflows automatically set this for you, nothing needed here)

### `path`
**Required** Path to the Istanbul 'coverage-summary.json' file in your repo

### `title`
**Required** Title of the report 


## Outputs

### `summary`
Summary of the report in json format. sample:
```json
{
    "lines": { "total": 0, "covered": 0, "skipped": 0, "pct": 0 },
    "functions": { "total": 0, "covered": 0, "skipped": 0, "pct": 0 },
    "statements": { "total": 0, "covered": 0, "skipped": 0, "pct": 0 },
    "branches": { "total": 0, "covered": 0, "skipped": 0, "pct": 0 }
}
```

## Preparation
Setup your test framework to use `Istanbul` to create coverage report as json file and thats it. just feed that file to this action as an input.

## Example usage

```yml
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, dev]

jobs:
  angular-test-coverage:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: angular test coverage update
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run Jasmine tests
        run: npm run test -- --no-watch --no-progress --browsers=ChromeHeadlessCI

      - name: Coverage report
        uses: eleboys/test-coverage-report-action@v1.0.2
        id: report
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          path: coverage/coverage-summary.json
          title: Karma Test Coverage

      - name: Print the output summary
        run: echo "Report coverage json ${{ steps.report.outputs.summary }}"
```
